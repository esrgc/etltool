Requirement Analysis
Data Upload - to be implemented
1. The app is responsible for data uploading in excel or csv format. Data file format is validated during upload.
2. If data is not in the right format error will occur and the app will prompt to try again with valid file format.
3. Data is uploaded when the file is in correct format.
4. Data is parsed on the server and put in dymanic object. This object is used to redisplayed the data for verification.

Data verification
1. Redisplay the data uploaded for verification.
2. Allow user to select the data fields (columns) that contains data required by NTIA.
3. Verify selection on client side.
4. Gather user selection and attempt to show preview dynamically.

Data matching (server process)
1. Attempt to match selection to NTIA data model.
2. Check for errors and data mismatched. (loop through data for each column).
3. Display error if occured.
4. If no error occures starts looping through data and create NTIA data objects.
5. After all data objects are created, redisplay to confirm that data is being submitted. 
6. Confirm sucsessful upload.
